Polymorphism - Polymorphism is the core feature of OOPS.(poly means many, Morphism means forms)
    An entity showing the Behaviour of another entity at different situations is known as polymorphism.

    Polymorphism is of two types :
        1. Compile-time polymorphism
            * The call to the overloaded method is resolved at compile-time by compiler(JAVA C) based on argument/parameter type 
                is known as compile-time polymorphism.
            * Method Overloading achives compile-time polymorphism.
        2. Run-time polymorphism
            * The call to the overridden methods is resolved at Runtime by JVM based on the instance is known as Run-time polymorphism.
            * Method overridding achives Run-time polymorphism.
    
    Advantages of polymorphism.
    1. User/Developer Friendly.
    2. Code Reusability
    3. Achives loose coupling
    4. Achives abstraction

Tight coupling - If service provider code and end user code is connected in such a way 
that any changes made in service provider code will directly affect the end user code.

Loose coupling - If service provider code and end user code is connected in such a way 
that any changes made in service provider code will not affect the end user code because interface comes in between.
