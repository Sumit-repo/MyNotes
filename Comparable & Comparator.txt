Comparable - It is a pre-defined functional interface.
    * it is present in java.lang package
    * Comparable interface have a method named compareTo(object o)
    * By using Comparable interface we can sort collection of objects.
    * sort method internally uses compareTo method.
        * In compareTo method we can compare two objects if the current object is greater than passed object.
            then we have to return +ve value
        * If current object is lesser than passed object then we have to return -ve value.
        * Otherwise return 0.

    * By using Comparable we can achive single sorting sequence.
    (We can compare only one attribute at a time).


    To compare two string values we can use string class compareTo method which is already overridden.
        In java String class implements Comparable interface.

Comparator - It is a pre-defined functional interface.
    * It is present in java.util package.
    * Comparator interface have a method named compare(obj 01,obj 02)
    * By using Comparator we can sort collection of object.
    * By using Comparator we can achive custom sorting.
    
Disadvantages of Comparable:
    * using Comparable interface we can compare two objects by using one attribute at a time.
    * default sorting order in objects.


Comparable 
    * It follows single sorting sequence
