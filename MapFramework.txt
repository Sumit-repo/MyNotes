Map : it is a set of Key-value pairs.
    * it is a predefined interface present in java.util package.
    * Map is not a sub-type of Collection interface.
    * Map contains unique keys, we cant have duplicate keys in Map.
    * key cant be a null.
    * insertion, updation and deletion based on key.
    * value can be duplicate.

Hashmap : It is a predefined sub-class of Map interface.
    * It was introduced in JDK 1.2.
    * present in java.util package.
    * It underlined DS is HashTable.
    * It doesnt follow insertion order.
    * duplicate key are not allowed.

LinkedHashmap : It is a predefined sub-class of Map interface.
    * It was introduced in JDK 1.2.
    * present in java.util package
    * It is same as HashMap but it preservs insertion order.

TreeMap : It is a predefined sub-class of SortedMap.
    * TreeMap Mainly used for sort element based on key values.
    * It Internally uses Comarable and Comparator interfaces to sort element.
    * We cant insert one null also.
    * We can store only homogenious type data 

            HashMap                                 HashTable
It was introduced in JDK 1.2 util.       It was introduced in JDK 1.0 util(legacy class).
Multi threaded.                          Single threaded.
Not syncronised                          syncronised.
faster                                   slower
Hashing technique                        Hashing technique
We can have one null                     No null allowed
