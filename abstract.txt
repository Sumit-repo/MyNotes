concrete - complete
abstract - incomplete
Abstract:
•	Abstract is keyword and it is a modifier.
•	Abstract keyword is used for methods and classes.
•	If any class is having any abstract method then it is mandatory to make the whole class as abstract class
•	Abstract keyword we can’t use for variables.

Abstract method:
•	The method pre-fixed with abstract keyword is known as abstract method.
•	Abstract method is also known as incomplete method.
•	Abstract method always ended with (semi-colon ;)
•	Abstract method doesn’t contain any method body it contain only method declaration.

concrete method
•	A method with body or a method with complete implementation is known a concrete method.
concrete class
•	A class can’t have abstract methods.
.   It can be instantiated(objects can be created).
•	concrete class contain methods with full implementation.
Abstract class
•	A class prefixed with abstract keyword the class in known as abstract class.
•	We can’t instantiate abstract class (we can’t create object).
•	Abstract class just like a normal class.
•	Abstract class is also known as incomplete class.
•	In case if a class having one abstract method then it is mandatory to make class as abstract.
•	Which method we can’t overwrite those we can’t make them abstract.
•	Abstract class can contain concrete methods also. 

•	public abstract static void.m1( );
•	public abstract final void m1( );
•	private abstract void m1( );

•	abstract public void m1( );
•	public abstract void m1( ); 

Note:
We can make non-static non-private non final methods as abstract method.
Who will provide body for abstract methods?
 Sub class (The class which is extends abstract class the class have to provide body for abstract methods).
