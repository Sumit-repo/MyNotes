DSA - 
    1. Linear DS : the data will be arranged in sequencial manner.
        Arraylist, Stack, Queue, LinkedList
    2. Non Linear : The data will be arranged in non sequencial manner (hirercial manner)
        1. Trees
            1. Binary Tree
            2. Binary search tree.
        2. Graph

Advantages :
    - More efficient program to store data.
    - Easy to perform insertion and deletion Operations.
    - DS are performance wise faster.
    - We can store heterogenious type data.
    - Time management
    - Dynamic memory (size is not fixed).
